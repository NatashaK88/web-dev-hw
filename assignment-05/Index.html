<h1> White Fang by Jack London </h1>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Much of White Fang is written from the viewpoint of the
    canine character, enabling London to explore how
    animals view their world and how they view humans. White
    Fang examines the violent world of wild animals and the
    equally violent world of humans. The book also
    explores complex themes including morality and redemption. </p>
