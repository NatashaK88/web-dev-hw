  Lyrics
I'm always singing 'bout my fickle feelings <br>
'Cause there ain't no antidote <br>
Laying here in silence <br>
'Cause I cannot find the damn remote <br>
Even if I found it I would probably just flip, flip and flip <br>
n the midst of August <br>
Getting started on my Christmas list <br>
I been thinking 'bout you <br>
And I wanna go do something nice <br>
I can't take rejection <br>
And that's why I pay the crazy price <br>
If you ain't ecstatic I feel like I blew it big time <br>
I'm a little manic <br>
I just wanna see your big smile <br>
Nothing means more to me <br>
Than when I hear that you're proud of me <br>
Acting like a kid <br>
Because I never quite learned how to be<br>
Peanut butter waffles<br>
When it's dinner time and I'm alone<br>
Hiding in my castle<br>
But the walls are made of styrofoam<br>
I know, there's no in between<br>
It's either high, low<br>
You know how to balance but I don't<br>
I wish I could finally just find home<br>
I know, there's no in between<br>
It's either high, low<br>
You know how to balance but I don't<br>
I wish I could finally just find home<br>
I'm drinking coffee at 3 a.m.<br>
Playing Battlegrounds and Overwatch<br>
Volume up to fifty<br>
'Cause it get too trippy if it's not<br>
I can hear the fridge buzz<br>
I can hear my thoughts clear<br>
I can hear the room ring<br>
I can hear who's not here<br>
I let my lil' bro talk me<br>
Into buying designer clothes<br>
He tell me I'm flexing<br>
But I don't even feel kinda close<br>
Them bitches were brand new<br>
But they look like old shoes<br>
Could've bought a puppy<br>
Or 220 cold brews<br>
When somebody ask me how I been<br>
I get too personal<br>
Catching up and small talk<br>
Are two things I never learned to do<br>
I make life decisions in the time<br>
It take to brush my teeth<br>
Can't remember where I been<br>
Don't know where I'm gonna be<br>
I know, there's no in between<br>
It's either high, low<br>
You know how to balance but I don't<br>
I wish I could finally just find home<br>
I know, there's no in between<br>
It's either high, low<br>
You know how to balance but I don't<br>
I wish I could finally just find home<br>
Na, na, na, na<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Na, na<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
I wish I could finally just find home<br>
Na, na, na, na<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Na, na<br>
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
I wish I could finally just find home<br>
